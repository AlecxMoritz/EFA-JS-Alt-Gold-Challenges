/*  Objects and Loggers
    Create two functions. One function will server as a simple logger. It will accept a value, and print it to the console.

    The second function should accept an object, and print all key/value pairs, USING the logger function. 
    ( the second function will not call console.log(), but will pass any value it needs printed to the logger function)
